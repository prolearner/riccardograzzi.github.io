## About Me

I like to study and design efficient and scalable machine learning methods. 
My main focus is on state-tracking and quantization for LLMs. I am a Researcher at Microsoft Cambrdige, and was a Post Doc at IIT in Genoa,
and before that a PhD Student at IIT and UCL.

<!-- ## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning -->
