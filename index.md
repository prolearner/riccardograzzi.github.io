## About Me

I am a Researcher at Microsoft Cambrdige, was a Post Doc at IIT in Genoa,
and before that a PhD Student at IIT and UCL.

I like to study and design efficient and scalable machine learning methods. 
My main focus is on state-tracking and in-context learning for LLMs.

Previously, I worked on efficient gradient-based bilevel optimization, with applications to hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning. In particular, I studied the rate of convergence in deterministic, stochastic and non-smooth settings. 

<!-- ## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning -->
