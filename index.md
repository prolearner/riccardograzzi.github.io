## About Me

I am a Post Doc in the CSML group in IIT in Genoa and was previously a PhD Student at IIT and UCL under the supervision of Massimiliano Pontil.

I like to study and design efficient and scalable machine learning methods. 
The main focus of my research has been on efficient gradient-based bilevel optimization, with applications to hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning. In particular, I studied the rate of convergence in deterministic and stochastic and non-smooth settings. 

More recently, I have been interested in in-context learning, adaptive, parameter-free optimization techniques and learning methods for dynamical systems.
